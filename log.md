# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've spent the day in the <a href="http://www.coderbunker.com/">bunker</a> bashing away on the Tic Tac Toe game for freeCodeCamp. The base styling is done, it's at a minimum functional; a bit more difficult than usual due to my choosing to avoid bootstrap for this project. As for the brains of the site, the JS, I've got the user inputs down and the conditions required for a win OR draw. In between bouts of confusion I also added the first blog post related to the fCC algorithms.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap, for a project like this would have been overkill; it's fine without it. As for the JS, the focus of today's work, I really need to sharpen up my understanding of data types and structures as well as algorithms. I'm hardcoding some conditionals where I could/should be using a clean algorithm with an equally clean object.
