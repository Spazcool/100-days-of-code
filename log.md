# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've spent the day in the <a href="http://www.coderbunker.com/">bunker</a> bashing away on the Tic Tac Toe game for freeCodeCamp. The base styling is done, it's at a minimum functional; a bit more difficult than usual due to my choosing to avoid bootstrap for this project. As for the brains of the site, the JS, I've got the user inputs down and the conditions required for a win OR draw. In between bouts of confusion I also added the first blog post related to the fCC algorithms.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap, for a project like this would have been overkill; it's fine without it. As for the JS, the focus of today's work, I really need to sharpen up my understanding of data types and structures as well as algorithms. I'm hardcoding some conditionals where I could/should be using a clean algorithm with an equally clean object.

### Day 2: March 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've spent the last couple of hours trying to style my nearly complete Pomodoro Timer. So far I've got the digits atop the screen atop the time setting slider. I've been hitting a wall here with relatively sizing the slider's div, as the stock JS hard codes its size in px. Also, I gave the user more flexibility in setting the time and uncovered a bit of a bug; if no time is set, the read out bugs out switching from 0 to -1. This can be escaped if the user pauses the timer and resets the timer.  

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap! While I definietly made some progress tonight, that set size for the slider remains a thorn in my side. I don't think it's a lack of understanding on my part just, the need for some juggling of ideas.

### Day 3: March 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent about 2 hours on just trying to get the the slider to resize, even sent an email to the developer asking if it can be sized with relative units. After banging my against that, I moved on to ripping out the bootstrap and relative units from my code; everything is hard-coded now and nearly in place...for this screen.

**Thoughts**: It's fucking annoying. That one piece not working has thrown a wrench into the whole of the works. I don't know if it's possible but, perhaps I can nest the divs using fixed values into a relative container; it sounds like a good idea but, I foresee problems.

### Day 4: March 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Ripped out the previous slider due to an inability on its part to resize responsively and an inability on my part to get it resized responsively. Moved the buttons a bit. Changed some of the colors. Added in a new simpler slider.

**Thoughts**: After yet another hour of fiddling with the previous pretty round slider, I just opted to tear it out and start over with the "stock" jQuery slider. It won't look quite as super awesome but, I need to cut my losses at this point; it's been ~4 hours tweaking pixels to get something that looked kinda ugly on any screen other than the one I'm working on. Simplify and get something that works out before the holiday is through.
