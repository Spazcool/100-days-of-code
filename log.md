# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: March 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've spent the day in the <a href="http://www.coderbunker.com/">bunker</a> bashing away on the Tic Tac Toe game for freeCodeCamp. The base styling is done, it's at a minimum functional; a bit more difficult than usual due to my choosing to avoid bootstrap for this project. As for the brains of the site, the JS, I've got the user inputs down and the conditions required for a win OR draw. In between bouts of confusion I also added the first blog post related to the fCC algorithms.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap, for a project like this would have been overkill; it's fine without it. As for the JS, the focus of today's work, I really need to sharpen up my understanding of data types and structures as well as algorithms. I'm hardcoding some conditionals where I could/should be using a clean algorithm with an equally clean object.

### Day 2: March 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've spent the last couple of hours trying to style my nearly complete Pomodoro Timer. So far I've got the digits atop the screen atop the time setting slider. I've been hitting a wall here with relatively sizing the slider's div, as the stock JS hard codes its size in px. Also, I gave the user more flexibility in setting the time and uncovered a bit of a bug; if no time is set, the read out bugs out switching from 0 to -1. This can be escaped if the user pauses the timer and resets the timer.  

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap! While I definietly made some progress tonight, that set size for the slider remains a thorn in my side. I don't think it's a lack of understanding on my part just, the need for some juggling of ideas.
